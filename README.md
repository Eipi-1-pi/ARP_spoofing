# Ethernet Stress

This repository contains scripts for network stress testing, specifically for Ethernet and WiFi connections.

## Requirements

To run the `wifi_stress.py` script, you need the following Python package:
- `aiohttp`
```
Install the required package using:
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

### Running the Script

To run the `wifi_stress.py` script, simply execute:
```sh
python wifi_stress.py
```

### Precompiled Versions

If you are unable to run the Python script directly, you can use the precompiled versions:
- `wifi_stress.zip`: Contains the compiled executable and necessary files.
- `wifi_stress.exe`: Direct executable for Windows.

Download and extract `wifi_stress.zip`, or run the standalone `wifi_stress.exe` on Windows.

### Notes

- Ensure you have Python 3.6 or newer installed.
- This script is cross-platform and should run on Windows, Linux, and macOS.
